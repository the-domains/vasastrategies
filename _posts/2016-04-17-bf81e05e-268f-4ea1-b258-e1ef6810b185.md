Vasa Strategies is a boutique consultancy focused on complementing clients' commercial and investment assessment assets with a view of community and global risks and impact. Bringing skills and expertise developed in the public policy and non-profit sectors, we provide innovative assessments on political and social risk for corporate decision-making and corporate social responsibility. 

Our work draws on concepts used in political risk, crime prevention, and social impact, with a focus on stabilization and radicalization to violent extremism. We use data-driven models to tailor information and results to clients' interests and facilitate targeted approaches for market entry and corporate social responsibility investments tailored to community and political trends and interests. From political risk assessment, management, and mitigation to corporate social responsibility, social impact leadership, and strategic communications, we can help your team navigate frontier and emerging markets, as well as to understand key security and political trends.
